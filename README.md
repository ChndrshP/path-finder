# PathFinder: BFS and DFS Visualizer

PathFinder is a visualization tool for Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms, designed to help users understand how these algorithms navigate through graphs.

### Live Link : 

## Features

- **Graph Visualization**: Visual representation of graph nodes and edges.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose between BFS and DFS algorithms.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Step through each iteration of the algorithm's process.
- **Node Customization**: Customize node placement and attributes.

## Steps

- **Setting up nodes**: Click "one" time to set intial point, "two" times to set final point and "three" times to set it as a wall
- **Giving inputs**: input numbers for the desired output
- **Start!!** - Click on the BFS or DFS button to start the algorithmm
- **Random Creation** - Creates a random maze of give dimensions
